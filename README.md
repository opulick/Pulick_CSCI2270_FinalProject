# Pulick_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Summer 2017
Project Description
For my project I am going to take in a list of random places in Colorado from a text file. And then starting to insert the places into a graph formation. Once all placed the points of interest will have assigned distances and 3 questions at each place. The linked list will be the set of questions at each POI. The user inputs a starting position and a final destination. Depending at each point of interest the player is asked the set of questions and if they answer them correctly then they are allowed to take the shortest path if not then they are taking the longest path.
